Welcome to the Hangman Game

Hello, welcome to the hangman game, where you, as the user, 
will have to enter letters that will be evaluated by the computer 
to determine if you guessed correctly and won.

This program features 7 topic categories, and you will have only six 
opportunities. According to the original rules of the game, each time you fail, 
the hanged character will be drawn, and your opportunities will decrease. If you 
don't fail, you will be closer to winning. Good luck!

This manual assumes you know how to play. Otherwise, we recommend watching a tutorial.
